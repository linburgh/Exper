c) Modify the source code and incorporate the recompiled class files into software application products that Customer develops.

Notwithstanding any provisions in this License Agreement to the contrary, Customer MAY NOT:
a) Distribute in any manner any of the source code, SAMPLE CODE or documentation of the Software except as combined with Customer's own source code pursuant to an escrow agreement as protective of Customer and its licensors as any other Customer escrow agreement and which permits use of the source code solely to service and maintain end users in the event Customer materially fails to provide such services.
b) Use, copy, modify, merge or compile all or any portion of the source code or object code or REDISTRIBUTABLES of the Software except as expressly provided in this License Agreement.

The source code of the Software is a valuable asset of Serva.  Customer agrees to keep all source code of the Software in confidence.  Except as expressly provided in this License Agreement, Customer may not transfer or assign the Software or Customer's rights under this License Agreement without Serva' consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) except to the transferee of all or substantially all of Customer's assets whether pursuant to a sale, merger, or otherwise.

Limited Warranty
Serva warrants that the Software will operate substantially in accordance with its user documentation, and that the media on which the Software is furnished will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the Software to Customer. Serva and its licensor do not otherwise warrant that the operation or execution of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or as to the accuracy or completeness of user documentation. 

Upon written notice from Customer within the thirty (30) day warranty period Serva' entire liability, and Customer's exclusive remedy, shall be: (i) the replacement of the media on which the Software is furnished if the media proves defective, (ii) repair or replace any defective Software, or (iii) if neither of these remedies is practical in Serva' sole opinion, Serva' authorized dealer from which Customer purchased the product may refund money Customer has paid as the License Fee under this agreement and Serva shall cancel this License Agreement and the licenses granted herein.  In the last event, Customer agrees to return all copies of the Software and certify in writing they have been removed from all Customer systems or destroyed.

This warranty is void if the media defect has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.  Any replacement of media will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period.  This warranty does not apply to failure of the Software to operate in accordance with the user documentation which results from (i) improper use of the Software not substantially in accordance with the related documentation, (ii) other conditions external to the Software that occur following the delivery of the Software by Serva, and (iii) any modifications to the Software not made by Serva or its agents. 

In connection with any warranty claim, Customer will use its best efforts to provide Serva with sufficient information to allow reproduction of any reported bugs.  

THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND NO OTHER WARRANTIES SHALL APPLY.  NORTHWOODS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL OTHER EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE. .

Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

U.S. Government Restricted Rights

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by any law, rule, order or regulation of any government or by the final determination of any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions not held invalid.

In the event a court of competent jurisdiction finds any of the provisions of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired but shall remain in full force and effect, unless such provision may be reduced in scope by the court to the extent it deems necessary to render the provision reasonable and enforceable, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to achieve a new legally enforceable provision(s) which most closely approximates the original intent of the provision(s) declared unenforceable or illegal.

It may not be modified except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.  If either party fails to enforce any term, failure to enforce on that occasion shall not prevent enforcement on any other occasion.
